Objective :

Our website consists of being able to talk on online chats depending on the games we choose. Its aim is to allow game enthusiasts to come together and be able to talk to each
other!

How to make it work ?

You need to copy the contents of the file "Launch BDD Web Project S7.sql" and copy the file contents into MySQL workbench. You then need to go to: config->db.config.cjs
And modify the information by putting yours instead.
To test the online chats of each game I advise you to open two instances of the site to send messages from different users.

Enjoy our web site !
